<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix </h3>
<p>The Matrix use of Alice in Wonderland mythology transformed a classic literary reference into a modern sci-fi metaphor, showing how intertextuality can bridge centuries and genres while adding philosophical depth.</p>
<h3>Stranger Things </h3>
<p>These creepy places share some key traits. They’re dark, scary versions of the real world. Bad things happen there. Characters often get trapped or lost in these alternate realms.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This ambiguous ending leaves audiences wondering if the main character is still dreaming. It’s a technique The Twilight Zone often employed in its episodes.</p>
